Genes, a simple family tree viewer in javascript
------------------------------------------------

I made this set of Javascript functions to keep track of my genealogy data since there
were no simple open source project available that gave me the tree display that I wanted.
Also, I like to have control of the data and not rely on import/export features spending
hours to understand how to convert between formats and potentially loose data. This 
approach allows me to add fields and link in data as I want, very easy.

The basic idea is to add genealogy records with a text editor at the end of the genes.js
I have commented the fields for some example records and filled them with some relatives 
to King Henry VIII. Just copy a record and change it for each relative you want to add.
The only relations needed to link the tree is the father and mother, the rest is figured
out by the scripts. Each individual also need a unique name identifier that is used for
links between indiviuals and their parents. Check the example and you'll get the hang of 
it.

This is just a simple start so if you want to get serious you probably want to get a 
real database based genalogy system. 

Have Fun!
